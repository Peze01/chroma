The aim is to select which two colours in the palette grid mix to make the colour at the top.
On Normal difficulty, the grid has four colours to choose from.
On Hard difficulty, the grid has 9 colours to choose from.

##How it is made.
Uses a subtractive colour mixing algorithm to determine the resulting colour from palette of random colours.
Each of the colours in the palette are determined randomly.
By default, the R, G and B values can only be 255, 0 or 127.
